# Deep-Music-Analogy-Samples
- This is the recurrence for the paper: [Deep Music Analogy Via Latent Representation Disentanglement](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03626)
- This original code is at: [HERE](https://github.com/buggyyang/Deep-Music-Analogy-Demos)
- To run this program, first run train.py and stop when the loss reducing to about 0.02. Then run eval.py.
